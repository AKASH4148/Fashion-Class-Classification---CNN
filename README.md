# Fashion-Class-Classification---CNN
For this particular  project used the fashionmnist data. It's a data set that contains images of bags shoes and dresses. And we're asking the deep network to classify the images in to 10 classes.  So here wanted to build kind of an app per se or a model. They can look  at images and can tell us exactly what category in this image. Is it like a short? Is it a bag? Is it like a hat? and so on....

Fashion training set consists of 70K images devided into 60K training and 10K testing samples. Dataset samples consists of 28X28 grayscale image associated with label from 10 classes<br>

The top 10 classes as fallows:<br>

*   T-Shirt
*   Trouser
*   Pullover
*   Dress
*   Coat
*   Sandel
*   Shirt
*   Sneaker
*   Bag
*   Ankle Boot<br>

Each Image is 28 pixel in height and 28 pixel in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single Pixel value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of the pixel. Higher number means darker pixel. The pixel value is an integer Between 0 and 255

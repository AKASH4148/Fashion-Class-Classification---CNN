# Fashion-Class-Classification---CNN
For this particular  project used the fashionmnist data. It's a data set that contains images of bags shoes and dresses. And we're asking the deep network to classify the images in to 10 classes.  So here wanted to build kind of an app per se or a model. They can look  at images and can tell us exactly what category in this image. Is it like a short? Is it a bag? Is it like a hat? and so on....
